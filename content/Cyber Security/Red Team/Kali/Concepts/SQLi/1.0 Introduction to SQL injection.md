# SQL injection Overview
## What is SQL injection 
- A method of injecting malicious SQL code into a query that the web application sends to the database.
- The attacker’s goal is to change the query in a way that gives them unauthorized access or control over the data.

Most web applications store and retrieve data (e.g., content, user information) using a database on the back-end

User <--->Web Application <--->Application server<---> DBMS

- When a user sends an HTTP(S) request (like a form submission), the web application back-end makes queries to the database. 
- The query might use data from the user’s request to build the response.

If the user-supplied data is not handled or “sanitized” correctly, an attacker can manipulate the query to do something unintended.

- **Relational vs. Non-relational**:
    - SQL injection targets relational databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
    - Injections against non-relational (NoSQL) databases are called NoSQL injection.

## How does SQLi Work?
1. **Injecting Code**: Attackers typically insert extra SQL syntax—often via special characters like quotes (“'” or “"”)—into user input fields.
2. **Subverting the Original Query**: By adding SQL commands, attackers can alter the intended query logic, potentially executing additional or entirely new queries. Common techniques include:
    - **Stacked Queries**: Executing multiple queries in one go.
    - **UNION Queries**: Appending additional data retrieval queries to the original.
3. **Retrieving Data**: Attackers then capture the results of the injected queries—either by seeing the database’s error messages or capturing the returned data in the web application’s response.

##  Common Impacts of SQL Injection

1. **Data Breach**: Attackers can access sensitive data (e.g., usernames, passwords, credit card info)
2. **Account Takeover**: Stolen credentials can lead to unauthorized access to other systems or services.
3. **Privilege Escalation**: Attackers may bypass login checks or gain admin-level access to the application.
4. **Server Compromise**: In severe cases, attackers can read and write files on the server (placing backdoors and taking full control).

# Databases 
Prior to understanding how to preform SQL injections we need to have a understanding of Databases and how they function together with web applications to retrieve information.

Modern web applications use databases to a variety of store information. 
- files
- user data
- usernames
- passwords
ect....

Early applications used simple file-based databases which became slow and inefficient as data size grew we started using database management systems.

## Database management systems
What are DBMS?
These are Softwares that 
- creates
- hosts
- manages
- secures 
databases

**Types of DBMS**:

- **File-based**
- **Relational (RDBMS)**
- **NoSQL**
- **Graph**
- **Key/Value Stores**

Interactions can occur through command-line tools, graphical interfaces, or APIs.

Commonly used in banking, finance, education, and other sectors dealing with large volumes of data

### Key DBMS Features

1. **Concurrency**: Handles multiple simultaneous users without data corruption.
2. **Consistency**: Ensures data remains valid and consistent despite concurrent use.
3. **Security**: Employs authentication and permission controls to protect data.
4. **Reliability**: Simplifies backups and rollbacks in the event of data loss.
5. **Structured Query Language (SQL)**: Provides a straightforward way to interact with databases using statements like `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.

## Architecture

A **two-tier architecture** splits a software application into two main parts (**tiers**):

1. **Tier I** – The **Client Side**
2. **Tier II** – The **Server Side** (which includes **Middleware** and the **Database Management System**, or DBMS)

Why do we make this seperation?
This separation helps:
- organize the code, 
- makes it easier to maintain, 
- allows each tier to handle different parts of the application logic
#### Detail
1. **Tier I**:
    
    - **Client-Side**: Websites or GUI programs where users log in, post comments, etc.
    - **Data Flow**: User actions are sent to the second tier via API calls or other requests.
2. **Tier II**:
    
    - **Middleware and Application Layer**: Interprets the requests and translates them into DBMS-friendly operations using libraries/drivers specific to the DBMS.
    - **DBMS**: Executes queries (insert, retrieve, delete, update) and returns any requested data or error codes.

## Deployment considerations
Same server vs separate server 
- Smaller or simpler setups may have the application server and the DBMS on the same machine.
- High-traffic or large-scale scenarios often separate them to boost performance and scalability.

# Types of Databases
There are 2 main types of databases:
- Relational - - databases prioritize **structured** data, relationships, and a powerful standardized query language (SQL). 
- Non-Relational - - databases offer more **flexibility** in how data is stored and queried, using specialized mechanisms tailored to different use cases (document, key-value, graph, etc.).

### Relational databases
- Relational databases store information in tables (think of them like spreadsheets) with rows, columns, and clearly defined relationships between tables.
- A database schema describes how these tables connect. For example, a `users` table might have columns like `id`, `username`, `first_name`, and `last_name`. Another table, `posts`, could reference `users` by storing `user_id`, which matches the `id` in `users`.

- **Keys and Relationships**
    
    - Each table has one or more keys (usually a primary key) that uniquely identifies each row.
    - Keys also link data across tables. For example, you use a user’s `id` in the `posts` table to find who made a particular post.
    - Because of these relationships, you can quickly retrieve related data with a single query (like finding all posts by a specific user).
### Non-relational Databases (NoSQL)
1. **Flexible Structure**
    
    - A NoSQL database does not rely on tables, rows, columns, or a predefined schema.
    - It can store data in various ways (key-value pairs, documents, wide-column stores, or graph structures), which is excellent when data doesn’t fit neatly into rows and columns.
2. **Common Models**
    
    - **Key-Value**: Data is stored as key-value pairs, often in JSON or XML format.
    - **Document-Based**: Data is stored in documents (often JSON-like), and each document can have a flexible structure.
    - **Wide-Column**: Data is spread across columns that can be dynamically created.
    - **Graph**: Data is stored as nodes and edges (relationships), used for complex connections like social networks.
3. **Scalability and Use Cases**
    
    - NoSQL databases are highly scalable and handle large or quickly changing datasets well.
    - They are popular when data doesn’t follow a strict structure or when applications need to handle huge amounts of data with minimal overhead.
    - A common example is MongoDB, which stores documents in a JSON-like format
