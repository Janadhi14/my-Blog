## Network Types
### Who owns the internet?
- not owned by one person or company 
- worldwide collection of interconncted networks cooperating with each other to exchange informationn using common standards 
- Internetwork or internet for short
- Through telephone wires, fiber optic cables, wireless transmissions and stalite links 

### Local networks
LAN - local area network
- various sizes
- can be from simple to connecting throusands of devices
- small office or home networks (SOHO) network
- In business, large networks can be used to advertise and sell products, order supplies, and communicate with customers.
- Communication over a network is usually more efficient and less expensive than traditional forms of communication, such as regular mail or long distance phone calls
- Networks allow for :
	- rapid communication such as email 
	- instant messaging
	- provide consolidation 
	- access to information stored on network servers
- The internet is considered a "network of networks" because it is literally made up of thousands of local networks that are connected to each other.

- **Small home networks** - connect a few computers to each other and to the internet 
- **Small office and home networks** - The SOHO network allows computers in a home office or a remote office to connect to a coperate network or access centralized, shared resources
- **Medium to large networks** -Medium to large networks, such as those used by corporations and schools, can have many locations with hundreds or thousands of interconnected hosts
- **World Wide Networks** -The internet is a network of networks that connects hundreds of millions of computers world-wide

### Mobile devices 
Smartphone - are able to connect to the internet from almost anywhere. Combines functions of many different products together such as a telephone, camera, GPPC reciever, media player and touch screen computer 
Tablet 
Smart. watch 
Smart glasses - HUD  with small touch pad 

### Connected Home devices 
- Security system
- Appliances 
- Smart TV
- Gaming Console


## **Data Transmission**
- There are different types of data
- Volunteer data - data that you agree to give out 
- inferred data- you don't know that you is being collected - eg your credit card data- the data is stored, preferences are being collected about you
- Observed data- your phone keeps track about your location - stored and transmitted to carrier. 
- stored in the cloud
### **The bit** 
- A bit is stored and transmitted as one of two possible discrete states
- Every input device (mouse, keyboard, voice-activated receiver) will translate human interaction into binary code for the CPU to process and store
- Within the computer itself, all data is processed and stored as binary
- A commonly used code is the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII).
- With ASCII, each character is represented by eight bits.
- Each group of eight bits, such as the representations of letters and numbers, is known as a byte.
- Codes can be used to represent almost any type of information digitally including computer data, graphics, photos, voice, video, and music.
### **Common methods of data transmission**
- Media refers to the physical medium on which the signals are transmitted.
- There are three common methods of signal transmission used in networks:
	- Electrical signals - electrical pulses on a copper wire
	- optical signals - electrical gets converted into light
	- Wireless signals- infrared or microwaves 
- Small networks- copper lines
- Larger networks - fibre
## Bandwidth and Throughput
Bandwidth: -  per second 
badnwidthis the maximum capacity of a medium to carry data 
digital bandwidth measures the amount of data that can flow from one place to another in a given amount of time 


Throughput: - time based 
Throughput is the measure of the transfer of bits across the media over a given period of time.
- Throughput measurements do not take into account the validity or usefulness

- **Bandwidth** is the theoretical maximum capacity of the network, while **throughput** is the actual data transfer rate you experience.
- **Throughput** is often less than **bandwidth** due to network inefficiencies, protocol overheads, congestion, and other factors.

## Summary
The following categories are used to classify types of personal data:

- **Volunteered data -** This is created and explicitly shared by individuals, such as social network profiles. This type of data might include video files, pictures, text, or audio files.
- **Observed data -** This is captured by recording the actions of individuals, such as location data when using cell phones.
- **Inferred data -** This is data such as a credit score, which is based on analysis of volunteered or observed data.
- 
There are three common methods of signal transmission used in networks:

- **Electrical signals -** Transmission is achieved by representing data as electrical pulses on copper wire.
- **Optical signals -** Transmission is achieved by converting the electrical signals into light pulses.
- **Wireless signals -** Transmission is achieved by using infrared, microwave, or radio waves through the air.
