## Clients and Servers
In modern networks, computers hosts can act as a client, server or both 
- Servers - have software installed to provide services to host on a networks
- clients - have software installed to request and display information from servers
## Client and server roles
All computers connected to a network that participate directly in network communication are classified as hosts
- hosts can send and receive messages on the network 
## Peer to Peer networks 
- Client and server ususally run on seperate servers 
- In small businesses and homes, many computers function as the servers and clients on the network. This type of network is called a peer-to-peer (P2P) network.
- The simplest P2P network consists of two directly connected computers using either a wired or wireless connection
- Multiple PCs can also be connected to create a larger P2P network but this will require a network device such as a switch that functions to connect the computers 
- Main disadvantage of a P2P environment is that the performance of a host can be slowed down if it is acting as both a client and a server at the same time 
- In larger businesses we should have dedicated servers to support the larger number of service requests 
Advantages:
- easy to set up 
- not complex 
- costs less 
- can be used for simple tasks
Disadvantage
- no centralised administration
- not secure 
- not scalable
- all devices may act as both client and servers which can slow performance
## Peer to Peer applications
- peer to peer applications allow a device to act as both a client and a server within the same communication
- In this model every client is a server and every server is a client 
- Â P2P applications require that each end device provide a user interface and run a background service.
- Some P2P apps use a hybrid system where the there is decentralised resource sharing but the indexes that point to resource locations are stored in a central directory 
- In a hybrid system, each peer accesses an index server to get the location of a resource stored on another peer.
- Both clients can simultaneously send and receive messages
## Multiple roles in the network 
- A computer wifi server software can provide services simultaneously to one or many clients 
- a single computer can also run multiple types of server software. In a home or small business, it may be necessary for one computer to act as a file server, a web server, and an email server.
