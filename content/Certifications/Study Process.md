## Refining My study process
Learning is different for everyone.

When learning new things you can seperate information into **facts** and **concepts**:
- The best way to remember **factual** information is through **spaced repetition**:
	- For this I use Anki which is a free spaced repetition software that you can modify the repetition intervals to suit your recalling ability:
	- Close selection cards seem to be the best for recalling imo.

	- [[https://docs.ankiweb.net/editing.html| Anki Manual]]
		- Current settings:
			- Learning intervals: 25m 1d
			- Graduating interval: 3
			- Easy interval: 4
			- Relearning step: 30m
			- Minimum interval: 1
			- Leech threshold: 8
	- When you watch a tutorial or read factual information that I need to remember, I will create an Anki card for the specific information and then the following day I will aim to complete the deck 
- For information that is **conceptual** you should attempt to applying and practicing these concepts. 
	- Conceptual content can be further broken down into skills that can be applied and processes.
		- The only way to get good at skills that can be applied is to do them repeated to build that muscle memory.
		- Process based concepts can be tricky but the best way I have found to remember these is through Anki through close selections especially diagram based processes.
