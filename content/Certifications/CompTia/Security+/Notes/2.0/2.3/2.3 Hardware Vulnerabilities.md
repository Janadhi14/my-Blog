## What are hardware vulnerabilities
Hardware vulnerabilities refer to security weaknesses that stem from a device’s physical components or the firmware running on them. Unlike software vulnerabilities that can often be patched or updated relatively quickly, hardware vulnerabilities can be more difficult to fix because they may require physical replacements or complex firmware updates

eg: BMS controllers, these are devices that contain firmware that cannot generally cannot have software patches applied to them 

IoT devices present more risk as they increase the attack surface for attackers as they add more vulnerabilities 
 
## Firmware
**Firmware** is a **specialized type of low-level software** that’s **embedded into hardware components**. It lives in non-volatile memory (like flash memory or ROM) on devices such as motherboards, routers, or peripherals

The only people that can fix the hardware are the manufacturers who don't have as much of a focus on fixing the vulnerabilities as security professionals have. 

Example: Trane comfortlink 2 thermostats 
- ﻿﻿Control the temperature from your phone
- ﻿﻿Trane notified of three vulnerabilities in April 2014
- ﻿﻿Two patched in April 2015, one in January 2016

## End of Life 
End of life is when the manufacture stops selling a product 
- The manufacturer may continue supporting 
- important for security patches and updates 
End of service life is when the manufacturer stops selling the device and the support is no longer available for the product
- no ongoing security patches or updates 
- May have a premium- cost for support options

Technology EOSL is a significant concern as the security patches are a normal part of operations and now there wont be anymore

## Legacy Platforms
Legacy devices are devices that remaining installed for a long time 
- some of these devices may have older cooperating systems, applications, middleware 
-  It may be possible that the firmware on these devices may be at their EOL or EOSL
- We must compare the risk of 
- If the device plays a critical role in the organizations infrastructure so it may not be as easy as replacing the device. 
	- we must keep the device running but we need to create mitigations to prevent exploitations of vulnerabilities that the legacy device may have
