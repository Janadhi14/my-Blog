## What is Buffer Overflow?
Buffer overflow attack is where a threat actor intentionally cause the program to write into another area of memory 

- normally the developer should be preforming the bounds checking but the attackers spend a lot of time looking for openings where they can exploit this vulnerability 
Not a simple exploit because:
- It takes time to avoid crashing things as most applications will crash when you overflow the buffer
- it also takes time to make the application do what you want,
