## Finding malware 
Everything running on your computer uses your memory and thus:
- Malware needs to be in memory in order to run
- memory forensics can find the malicious code
- There are many processes that are stored in memory 
- Malware is hidden somewhere in memory
	- It can run its own process 
	- It can inject itself into a legitimate process

## Memory injection
**Memory injection** is a technique used by attackers to **insert malicious code directly into the memory** space of a running process on a target system.

Unlike traditional malware that might install files on disk, memory injection often operates completely in **RAM**, making it **harder to detect** with standard antivirus or file integrity monitoring solutions. 

By running code in memory, attackers can bypass certain security controls and make their activities more stealthy.

- This means the malware gets access to the data in that process 
- Has the same rights and permissions 
- and thus can preform a privilege escalation

## DLL injection
DLL stands for **dynamic-link library**, these are libraries and data that can be used by multiple 
- A **windows library** containing code and data 
- Many applications can use the same library to avoid duplication of code on a system

Attackers inject a path to a malicious DLL 
- Runs as part of a target process 

DLL, or Dynamically Linked Library. 

Instead of being an application itself, it is a collection of functions or data that can be used by another application. One example would be a video codec that can interpret .mp4 files. Multiple programs (such as your web browser, media player, messaging program, etc) may use the same video-decoding DLL, as part of displaying videos. This helps reduce code duplication across programs that may have similar functionality. When a DLL is referenced by an application, the operating system loads the DLL into memory alongside the source application, so the application can utilize its functions. Without the application voluntarily using the DLL's code, it doesn't do anything. If an attacker is able to modify a DLL to perform malicious tasks instead of the correct things, it could potentially perform those tasks under the same privileges as the application that is using it.
