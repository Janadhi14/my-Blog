## What are Zero days
A **zero-day vulnerability** refers to a security flaw in software, hardware, or firmware that is unknown to the vendor or developer at the time of discovery by attackers. Since the vendor has had "zero days" to address and patch the vulnerability, it can be exploited by attackers before a fix becomes available. These vulnerabilities are particularly dangerous because they can be used to launch attacks without immediate detection or mitigation options. Zero-day exploits are often highly sought after in the cybercriminal and state-sponsored hacker communities due to their effectiveness and the element of surprise they provide.

## Zero-day attackers
- Attackers search for unknown vulnerabilities that they can create exploits against 
- the vendor will have no idea that the vulnerability exists and thus they don't have a fix for an unknown problem
- If the attackers exploit this vulnerability that the vendors have no idea about then we refer to this as a zero day attack.
## Zero day attack examples
- April 2023 - Chrome zero-day
	- Memory corruption, sandbox escape
• May 2023 - Microsoft zero-day patch
- Secure boot zero-day vulnerability
- Attacker can run UEFI-level self-signed code
• May 2023 - Apple iOS and iPadOS zero-days
- Three zero-day patches
- Sandbox escape, disclosure of sensitive information, arbitrary code execution
- Active exploitations
