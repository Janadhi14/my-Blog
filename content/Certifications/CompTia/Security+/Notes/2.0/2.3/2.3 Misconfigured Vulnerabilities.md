## Open permissions
One very easy for someone to leave information on a cloud platform or some open area of the internet. 

This is very common and attackers can use this as a way of reconnaissance 
- once they find some information that is openly available 
- they will download this information and then disseminate it 
An example of this when there was 14 million Verizon records exposed on an amazon s3 data repository. 
- A Thirds party left this information open 
- Fortunately a researcher found this information first and it didn't get into the wrong hands
## Unsecured Administrator Accounts
- **Superuser Accounts:**
    - **Linux:** Root account.
    - **Windows:** Administrator account.
    - Often referred to collectively as the "superuser" account.
- **Common Vulnerabilities:**
    - Assigning weak, easily guessable passwords (e.g., "123456," "ninja," "football").
    - Allowing direct login to administrator accounts.
- **Best Practices:**
    - **Disable Direct Admin Logins:**
        - Require logging in with a standard user account.
        - Use elevated access methods (e.g., `su`, `sudo` on Linux; "Run as administrator" on Windows) when necessary.
    - **Limit Administrative Accounts:**
        - Maintain a minimal number of accounts with root or administrator privileges to reduce attack vectors.
## Insecure protocols
- **Vulnerable Protocols:**
    - **Unsecured:** Telnet, FTP, SMTP, IMAP. 
    - **Secure Alternatives:** SSH, SFTP, HTTPS.
- **Importance of Encryption:**
    - Encryption protects data transmitted over networks from being easily intercepted and read.
## Default Credentials and Botnets**
- **Issue with Default Accounts:**
    - Many IoT devices come with default usernames and passwords.
    - Users often neglect to change these credentials, leaving devices vulnerable.
- **Mirai Botnet:**
	- **Function:** Scans for IoT devices with default credentials and compromises them.
	- **Impact:** Creates a network of infected devices that can be used for further attacks.
	- **Availability:** Open source, allowing both attackers and researchers to utilize it for identifying vulnerable devices.
## Open ports and services 
- Services will open ports, such as applications that run on a device will require a port 
- Often managed with a firewall that allows traffic that is specified for a certain port 
- firewall rulesets can be complex but it is easy to make mistakes and leave ports open, 
	- attackers will normally run a nmap scan to see open ports on a certain IP 
	- 
- Always test and audit your network and firewall settings to ensure that there aren't unnecessary ports that are open
