## What are Malicious updates
**Malicious updates** are software updates (or patches) that have been tampered with by attackers to include harmful or unauthorized code

## Software updates
It is always best practice to keep your software updated and patched to the latest version however, it becomes an issue when

New patches typically address security weaknesses, so installing them promptly reduces the window in which attackers can exploit older code.

## Downloading and updating
While installing updates is generally best practice, there is an inherent risk that the update process itself could deliver malware (e.g., if attackers tamper with the update files).

- When installing an update from a downloaded file always consider your actions as you need to ensure that the file hasn't been tampered with and is a legitimate update file.
- Confirm the source of download
- Visiting the developers site directly 
- Many operating systems will only allow you to update if the application has been digitally signed 

Users must remain vigilant about the source and legitimacy of the update

## Built in updates 
**Built-in Update Mechanisms**

- Many applications have an internal update feature. This usually includes its own integrity checks and signature verification in the background.
- Even with these checks, attackers can (in rare cases) compromise the vendorâ€™s development or build processes, so due diligence is still advised

## Example
- **Example of a Supply Chain Attack: SolarWinds**
    
    - In December 2020, the Orion application from SolarWinds was compromised. Attackers inserted malicious code into the legitimate software update, which was then automatically signed and distributed to users.
    - This incident illustrates how a trusted update mechanism can be hijacked, affecting numerous high-profile organizations and government agencies.
