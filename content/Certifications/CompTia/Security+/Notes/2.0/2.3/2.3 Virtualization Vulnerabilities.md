## What are Virtual Vulnerabilities
Virtualization involves running multiple virtual machines (VMs) on a single physical host (or cluster of hosts). While this offers benefits like flexibility, isolation, and efficient resource usage, it also introduces unique security risks known as _virtual vulnerabilities_. These vulnerabilities may stem from the hypervisor (the software layer enabling multiple VMs to share hardware resources), misconfigurations in the virtual environment, or weaknesses in how VMs are isolated from each other

### Hypervisor
A hypervisor (also known as a virtual machine monitor or VMM) is software, firmware, or hardware that allows multiple operating systems (guest OSs) to run simultaneously on a single physical machine. It manages the hardware resources—CPU, memory, storage, and networking—and allocates them to each virtual machine (VM) securely and efficiently. There are two main types of hypervisors:
- **Type 1 (Bare-Metal Hypervisor):** Runs directly on the host’s hardware (e.g., VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V Server).
- **Type 2 (Hosted Hypervisor):** Runs on top of a conventional operating system (e.g., VMware Workstation, Oracle VirtualBox).
## VM escape protection
The virtual machine is generally thought of as "self contained", however there are instances where malware can escape or an attacker can move out of a virtual machine on a hypervisor to another machine on the hypervisor.

Example:
pwn2own competition where attackers used javascript bug in Microsoft edge to get into code execution in the edge sandbox. 
- exploited a vulnerability in the windows 10 Kernal to exploit the guest OS 
- From there used a hardware simulation bug in VMware and escape to the host
## Resource reuse
The hypervisor manages the relationship between the physical and virtual resources such as RAM, CPU and Storage

- Just because a hypervisor uses 
- If the hypervisor has a bug that allows for 2 different VMs to write to the same area of memory on the physical host then it may be possible in theory that the memory could be read by the other machine
