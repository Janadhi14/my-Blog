## Security in the cloud
Cloud adoption has been nearly universal and many organizations
embrace it 

There arises a problem with this as now we have put sensitive information in the cloud that attackers would like to get their hands on.

We need to put the right protections on these 
## Attack the service
- If you have an application on the public cloud then anyone in the world would be able to carry out a DOS or DDOS on this application.
- Authentication bypass is another vulnerability that can arise from cloud based services as we must ensure that we have the appropriate security measures in place for authentication
- Directory traversal is where attackers manipulate the file or directory path references used by an application in order to access areas of the file system that should be off-limits
- Remote code execution is a vulnerability that an attacker can use in a cloud based setting where if the system is unpatched they can run code to run ay application in your cloud based system.

## Attack the application
Web applications attacks have increased inn the last few years
- Attackers normally run XSS where the developer hasn't properly provided input validation
- Out of bounds write attacks is also common in a cloud based setting as the attacker will write into a section into memory, they can use this to run remote code execution, crashing the application or data corruption
- SQL injections are also common because if the application is in the cloud then the data is also in the cloud.
