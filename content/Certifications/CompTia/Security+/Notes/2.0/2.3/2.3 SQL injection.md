# What is SQL injection
SQL injection is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when an attacker is able to manipulate a web application's database query by inserting or injecting malicious SQL code into the query.

## Building a SQL injection
When a website interacts with a SQL database it uses queries to get information back.
for example:
```sql
"SELECT * FROM users WHERE name ='John'";
```
This will go through the data base and find the username of the individual named john

In the case of SQL injections, the user will use a phrase like OR '1'=1 which evaluates to TRUE and thus will export all the information for all users 
```sql
"SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'John' OR '1' = '1';"
```
This provides you with all access to the database information. 
- you could read
- delete 
- make changes 
- bring the database down
