## What are Operating system vulnerabilities 
**Operating system vulnerabilities** are flaws, weaknesses, or oversights in the design, implementation, or configuration of an operating system

## Operating system
The OS is the foundational computing platform:
- this makes it a big target for attackers
- Operating systems are run by every device user. this makes it essentially that the OS is always up to day and that 

Challenges that we face with operating systems is that:
- they consists of vast amounts of code this makes it a good target fro attackers as there is more opportunity for security issues 
- Larger the code the larger the attack surface

Each operating system will have many vulnerabilities, we just don't know that they are in there.
- eventually the vendor will patch and update them.

## A month of OS updates 
For Microsoft windows we receive updates on every Tuesday of a month, 2nd Tuesday of each month 
- other companies have a similar schedule 
Example patch Tuesday:
- May 9, 2023 - Nearly 50 security patches
	- ﻿﻿8 Elevation of Privilege Vulnerabilities
	- ﻿﻿4 Security Feature Bypass Vulnerabilities
	- ﻿12 Remote Code Execution Vulnerabilities
	- ﻿﻿8 Information Disclosure Vulnerabilities
	- ﻿5 Denial of Service Vulnerabilities
	- ﻿﻿1 Spoofing Vulnerability
## Best practices for OS patch updating  
- Always update when the monthly update comes out. 
- it is a race between you and the attackers, because once the update is sent out letting everyone know of the vulnerability then the attackers will start looking for this so they can use this.
- Updating in large environments may require testing prior to deployment because it could break something in the production environment.
- May require a reboot so thus we should save all the data
- There should also be a fall back plan such as a backup incase there are problems further down the line.
