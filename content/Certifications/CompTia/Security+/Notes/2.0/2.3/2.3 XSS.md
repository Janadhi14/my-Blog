## What is cross site scripting 
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a **type of security vulnerability** that allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts (usually JavaScript) into web pages viewed by other users. These scripts can then be executed in the browser of the victim, potentially compromising the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the user's data

## Different types of XSS
There are three main types of XSS attacks:
1. **Stored XSS**:
    - In this type, the malicious script is permanently stored on the target server (e.g., in a database or message board). When a user visits a page that retrieves this data, the script is executed in their browser.
    - Example: A user posts a comment on a forum containing malicious JavaScript. When another user views the comment, the script runs in their browser.
2. **Reflected XSS**: (non persistent)
    - In reflected XSS, the malicious script is reflected off the web server, typically via a URL or form submission. The attack is triggered when a user clicks on a specially crafted URL with the malicious script embedded in it.
    - Example: An attacker sends a link with a malicious script embedded in the URL to a victim. When the victim clicks the link, the script runs in their browser.
3. **DOM-based XSS**:
    
    - This occurs when the client-side JavaScript on a web page manipulates the DOM (Document Object Model) and executes untrusted data as code.
    - Example: If a web page uses JavaScript to read data from the URL or a form input and then dynamically writes it into the page without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious JavaScript into the DOM.
## Non persistent(reflected) XSS attack
- **Definition**: In **non-persistent XSS** (also known as **reflected XSS**), the malicious script is **not stored** on the server. Instead, it is "reflected" off the web server, typically as part of a URL or an HTTP request. The script is executed immediately when a user clicks on a specially crafted URL or submits a form with the malicious data.
    
- **How it works**:
    
    - The attacker crafts a malicious URL with a payload (e.g., an injected script) in the query string, form input, or HTTP headers.
    - When the victim clicks on the link or submits the form, the web server processes the request and "reflects" the malicious script back in the server's response (e.g., as part of the HTML returned to the browser).
    - The payload is executed immediately in the victim's browser, but it is not stored on the server.

## Persistent (stored) XSS attack: 
eg: stores the link on a website 
- **Definition**: In **persistent XSS**, the malicious script is **permanently stored** on the target server, such as in a database, comment section, or user profile. The payload is stored and then served to users who visit the page, triggering the attack when the content is loaded into the browser.
    
- **How it works**:
    
    - The attacker submits malicious input (e.g., a script) via a web form or another input method.
    - The malicious input is saved permanently on the server (in a database, file system, etc.).
    - Whenever a user visits the affected page that includes the malicious input, the script is executed in their browser.

## Protecting against XSS
- Don't click links that you don't trust
- Consider disabling Javascript or limiting Javascript functionality
- Keep your browser updated as this will contain the latest security updates to prevent your browser from running malicious scripts
