## Mobile device security
Mobile devices are relatively small and there are multiple characteristics that make them vulnerable:
- Always moving because they are easy to carry.
- packed with sensitive data and personal and organizational data
- Constantly connected to the internet through either wifi or through data 

## Jailbreaking/rooting
Mobile devices can already have a lot of security built into them already but one way to break this is through the use of jail breaking or rooting the phone.

- in order to replace the current operating system with one that will allows us to circumvent the restrictions that it has we can jail brake it or root it.

Android - rooting 
Apple IOS- Jailbreaking

We are now able to install custom firmware and replace the existing operating system

 If someone replaces the OS then they circumvent the security features that are built into the operating system. 

## Sideloading
Malicious apps can be a significant security concern because it can allow for access to the device that may contain other applications 
- **Unauthorized Application Installation:**
    - **Sideloading:** Installing applications from sources outside the official app stores, which can introduce malicious code. eg APK downloads
    - **Malicious Applications:** Even a single bad app can compromise all data on the device, making it accessible to attackers.
- **Restrictive Measures:**
    - **App Installation Policies:** Organizations often restrict app installations to approved sources such as the companyâ€™s global application library or a designated local app store.
    - **Controlled by OS or MDM:** Operating systems and MDM solutions enforce restrictions on what types of applications can be installed and their sources.

## Organizational policies and enforcement 
- **Policy Implementation:**
    - **Employee Handbooks and Acceptable Use Policies (AUPs):** Define rules against installing unauthorized operating systems or applications.
- **Consequences of Non-Compliance:**
    - **Disciplinary Actions:** Employees who circumvent security controls by jailbreaking/rooting or sideloading applications may face dismissal or other penalties.
