## Physical Attacks
- The physical version requires no passwords 
- There are may different ways to circumvent digital security but we must also consider **physical security** 
- If you have physical access to a server then you have full control of it 

## Brute force 
Brute force physical attacks can also be something that attackers will use to get into critical infrastructure. 
- locked doors and windows can be brute forced 


## RFID cloning 
RFID is commonly used for door access
- Access badges 
- Key fobs 
- Inexpensive to get RFID cloners that can quickly copy data from one RFID card/fob to another 
	- attacker could "bump" into a victims badge on a train or so ad quickly clone it
We can prevent this by using MFA:
- face 



## Environmental attacks
- **Definition**: Attacks on the supporting infrastructure (power, cooling, fire suppression, etc.).
- **Examples**:
    - **Power Outage**: Turning off power to cause a shutdown of all systems.
    - **HVAC Manipulation**: Disabling or manipulating the cooling system (overheating servers).
    - **Fire Suppression**: Improperly triggering the fire suppression system can cause damage or force a shutdown.
- **Why It Works**:
    - Attackers might not need access to the data center itselfâ€”utility access or HVAC systems can be targets from outside or from less-protected control rooms.
