## What is a replay attack?
A replay attack is where an attacker intercepts and reuses valid data (e.g., credentials) to impersonate a client and access a server.

**How It Works**:

1. Attacker captures network traffic using tools or techniques like:
    - **Physical network taps**.
    - **ARP poisoning**.
    - **Malware** on the victim's device.
2. Replays captured information (e.g., usernames, hashed passwords) to the server.
3. Server accepts the replayed information as legitimate.

**Example: 
Pass-the-Hash**:
- Attacker intercepts a username and hashed password during an authentication process.
- Replays the hash to gain unauthorized access to the server.

- **Mitigations**:
    1. **Encryption**: Encrypt network traffic (e.g., HTTPS) to prevent data capture.
    2. **Salting Passwords**:
        - Add a random value (salt) to passwords during hashing.
        - Ensures each hash is unique, even for identical passwords.
    3. **One-Time Hashes**:
        - Configure servers to reject duplicate hashes.
        - Prevents replay of previously used authentication hashes.
## Session Hijacking (Sidejacking)

- **Definition**: An attacker captures session IDs from cookies or headers to impersonate a user and gain unauthorized access.
- **Key Details**:
    - **Session Cookies**:
        - Store session IDs and other connection details.
        - Not executable but contain sensitive information.
    - **Attack Process**:
        1. Victim authenticates with a server using username and password.
        2. Server sends back a session ID for the authenticated session.
        3. Attacker intercepts the session ID using:
            - **Packet capture tools** (e.g., Wireshark, Kismet).
            - **Cross-site scripting (XSS)**.
            - Tools like **Firesheep**, **Scapy**, or **Tamper**.
        4. Attacker reuses the session ID to access the server as the victim.
    - **Impact**: Attacker gains full access to the victim's session and data on the server.

## Prevention
1. **Encryption**:
    - Use **HTTPS** to encrypt data between client and server.
    - Prevents attackers from capturing session IDs or other sensitive details.
    - Tools/extensions (e.g., HTTPS Everywhere) enforce HTTPS connections.
2. **Secure Cookies**:
    - Enable the **Secure** flag on cookies to ensure they're transmitted only over HTTPS.
    - Use the **HttpOnly** flag to prevent client-side access to cookies (e.g., via XSS).
3. **VPN Usage**:
    - Encrypt traffic between the device and a **VPN concentrator**.
    - Reduces the risk of interception on public or unsecured networks.
4. **Session Management**:
    - Use **short session timeouts** to limit session validity.
    - Implement mechanisms to **detect and invalidate duplicate session IDs**.
5. **Avoid Cleartext Connections**:
    - Ensure all sensitive traffic is encrypted end-to-end.
    - Avoid unencrypted connections wherever possible.
6. **Regular Updates**:
    - Patch servers, browsers, and applications to protect against known vulnerabilities.
