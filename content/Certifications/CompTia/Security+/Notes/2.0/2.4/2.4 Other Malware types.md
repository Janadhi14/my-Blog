## Keyloggers
**Keyloggers** are a type of malware that monitors and records every keystroke made on a computer, capturing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, credit card details, and more

- anything you type is not encrypted and thus key logging circumvents encryption
#### Type of data that can be captured by a key logger
- clipboard logging
- screen logging
- instant messaging
- search engine queries 
## Key logging in action
DarkComet-RAT is a Key logger
that is used to keep track o fall the keys that are typed and 
## Logic Bomb 
A **logic bomb** is malicious code that remains dormant within a system until a specific condition or event triggers its execution, leading to destructive actions.
- Very difficult to identify because there are no predefined signatures
- Can be Time based
- Can be user event based 

## Example
March 19 of 2013 in Korea
Malicious email was sent to south Korean organisations
Posed as a bank email
Trojan installs malware 
on March 20th the logic bomb activated and deleted the master boot records deleted on the devices 
- teller machines' OS was deleted 

## Preventing Logic bombs
- It is difficult to identify where a logic bomb has been installed  because there are no known signatures 
- There are processes and procedures to limit the chance of it happening
	- You can set up monitoring for files that will have alerts on changes that have been made to your files.
	- Host-based intrusion detection, tripwire 
	- Constant monitoring on the administration priviliges in an organization as not everyone needs admin 
## Rootkits
- This is originally a unix technique 
- A rootkit is a Malicious software that hides itself at a very low level (often in the kernel) of the operating system
**Why They’re Dangerous**:
    - Integrate deeply into the OS, making them invisible to standard antivirus scans.
    - May not appear in normal process listings since they run with kernel-level privileges.
    - Can intercept and modify OS operations without detection.
**Detection/Removal**:
- Traditional antivirus often misses kernel-based rootkits.
- Specialized rootkit removal tools may be needed.
- **Secure Boot (UEFI BIOS)**: Checks the OS kernel’s signature before booting. If altered, the system will not load the modified kernel
