## 802.11 Management frames
#### **Wireless Deauthentication Attack**

- **Definition**: A denial-of-service (DoS) attack disconnecting users from a wireless network repeatedly.
- **Key Details**:
    - Targets **management frames** in 802.11 protocols used for connection management (e.g., authentication and deauthentication).
    - Early 802.11 versions had **no encryption for management frames**, making them susceptible to manipulation.
    - Attackers exploit the clear-text nature of these frames to send **deauthentication commands**.
- **How It Works**:
    1. Attacker identifies the target device's MAC address (e.g., using `airodump-ng`).
    2. Uses tools like `aireplay-ng` to send deauthentication frames.
    3. Prevents the victim from reconnecting as long as the attack continues.
- **Mitigations**:
    - **802.11ac and newer standards**: Encrypt management frames (e.g., deauthenticate and disassociate frames) to prevent manipulation.
    - However, some frames like **beacons, probes, authentication, and association frames** remain unencrypted.
## Radio Frequency Jamming
- **Definition**: A DoS attack where attackers disrupt wireless communication by overwhelming the network with noise or interference.
- **Key Details**:
    - Reduces the **signal-to-noise ratio**, making it difficult for devices to communicate with the access point.
    - Can affect all devices on a wireless network, not just a single target.
- **Types of Jamming**:
    1. **Constant Jamming**: Sends continuous interference.
    2. **Random Jamming**: Sends noise intermittently or at specific times.
    3. **Reactive Jamming**: Activates only when network activity is detected.
    4. **Legitimate Frame Flooding**: Sends many valid frames to overload the network.
- **Common Causes**:
    - Unintentional: Microwave ovens, fluorescent lights (interference on 2.4 GHz networks).
    - Intentional: Attackers using jamming devices near the access point.
- **Mitigation and Detection**:
    - Locate the jammer using **directional antennas** or **attenuators**.
    - Perform a **"fox hunt"** to identify the source of interference.
