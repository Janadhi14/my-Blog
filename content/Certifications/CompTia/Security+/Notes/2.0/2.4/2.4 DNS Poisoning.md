## What is DNS poisoning?
DNS poisoning is sometimes referred to as DNs spoofing and is an attack that manipulates the DNS queries. 
- DNS 
There are multiple attack methods for DNS poisoning

1. **Modifying DNS Server**:
    - Rare as DNS servers are well-protected.
    - Attackers may exploit vulnerabilities or gain administrative credentials.
    - Example: Attacker changes DNS record for a domain (e.g., professormesser.com) to point to their IP instead of the legitimate one.
2. **Modifying Local Host Files**:
    - Requires attacker access to the client machine with elevated rights.
    - Host file contains domain-IP mappings, bypassing DNS server queries.
3. **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks**:
    - Intercept and manipulate DNS queries in real-time to redirect users.
4. **Domain Registration Hijacking**:
    - Attacker gains access to domain registrar accounts (via brute force, social engineering, or leaked credentials).
    - Modifies DNS settings to redirect traffic.
## Example of MITM

## Example of Domain registration Hijacking
- Attackers modified DNS settings of 36 domains for 6 hours.
- Redirected traffic to collect sensitive financial data.
- Over 5 million customers and $27 billion in assets were impacted.

## URL Hijacking (Typosquatting/Brandjacking)

- **Definition**: Exploiting user typos or lookalike domains to redirect users.
- **Methods**:
    1. **Misspelled Domains**:
        - E.g., `professormessor.com` instead of `professormesser.com`.
    2. **Extra/Removed Letters**:
        - E.g., `professormessers.com` or `professormesse.com`.
    3. **Different Top-Level Domains (TLDs)**:
        - E.g., `professormesser.org` instead of `.com`.
- **Attacker Objectives**:
    - **Ad Revenue**: Redirect to ad-filled sites.
    - **Credential Theft**: Phishing sites mimic legitimate ones to collect login details.
    - **Malware Delivery**: Prompt users to download ransomware or botnet software.
    - **Competitive Sabotage**: Redirect traffic to a competitor's website.
    - **Domain Reselling**: Sell misspelled domains back to the legitimate domain owner.
 #### **Preventive Measures**

- Avoid clicking links in unsolicited emails.
- Verify domain names carefully before entering credentials.
- Use security tools like DNSSEC to ensure DNS integrity.
