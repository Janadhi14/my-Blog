## What is denial of service?
A DoS attack forces a service to fail or become unavailable
- Often done by **overloading** a service (e.g., saturating bandwidth or using up server resources).
- Can also exploit a **vulnerability** or design flaw in an application or operating system.

Why would someone want to do this?
- **Disruption or sabotage** (e.g., removing a competitor from the internet).
- **Smokescreen**: A DoS can distract defenders while attackers exploit a different vulnerability.

Examples of Simple DoS:
- Pulling the Plug: Physically removing power from a server or network device.
- Network Loops: Plugging two switches into each other twice creates a loop and can take down a network if spanning tree isn’t enabled.
- Bandwidth Exhaustion: Downloading very large files over a limited connection can unintentionally DoS legitimate services.
- Environmental Failure: A broken water line in the data center or power/HVAC failure causing systems to shut down.
## A Friendly DoS
It is possible that we unintentionallly DoS outselves like when we:
- Network Loops: Plugging two switches into each other twice creates a loop and can take down a network if spanning tree isn’t enabled.
- Bandwidth Exhaustion: Downloading very large files over a limited connection can unintentionally DoS legitimate services.
- Water line breaks that is pleaced above the data center causing the dos
## Distributed denial of service 
Uses multiple compromised systems (**botnets**) to launch a coordinated attack against a single target

- **Definition**: Uses multiple compromised systems (**botnets**) to launch a coordinated attack against a single target.
    
- **Why It’s Powerful**:
    
    - Attack traffic originates from many sources worldwide.
    - A single attacker, via **Command and Control** (C2), instructs thousands or millions of infected “bots” to flood the target.
- **Example**:
    
    - **Zeus Botnet** once had over 3.6 million computers, allowing a single attacker to direct massive traffic against any chosen target.
- **Asymmetric Threat**:
    
    - A small, low-resource attacker can overwhelm high-resource organizations using many compromised machines.


## DDoS Reflection and Amplification 
- **Concept**: Attackers send small requests to legitimate internet services (DNS, NTP, ICMP) that respond with **much larger** replies.
- **Result**: The target receives large amounts of unsolicited traffic—amplifying the DoS effect.

### DNS Amplification Example

- **Small DNS Query**: `dig ANY isc.org` (≈15 bytes).
- **Large DNS Response**: ≈1,300 bytes returned (an 86× amplification).
- **Process**:
    1. Botnet sends **spoofed requests** to open (misconfigured) DNS resolvers.
    2. DNS resolvers send **large responses** back to the spoofed IP (the victim).
    3. Victim receives an overwhelming flood of amplified DNS replies.
