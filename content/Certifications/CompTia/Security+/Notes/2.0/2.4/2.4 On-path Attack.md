## What is an on path attack?
An on path attack is when an attacker intercepts and potentially modifies traffic between two devices without their knowledge.
- The fact that there is a man in the middle makes it invisible to the victim devices
- Allows for monitoring and manipulation of data in real time
## ARP poisoning (ARP spoofing)
- **Definition**: A type of on-path attack that exploits the lack of security in the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) to intercept traffic on a local subnet.
- **Normal ARP Communication**:

- Device sends a broadcast to resolve the MAC address for a known IP address.
- Target device replies with its MAC address, which is stored in the ARP cache.

1. **Attack Process**:
    - Attacker sends a forged ARP response to victim devices, claiming to be the target IP address.
    - Victims update their ARP cache with the attacker’s MAC address for the target IP.
    - All traffic between the victim devices passes through the attacker’s device.
- **Example**:
	- Victim laptop (192.168.1.9) communicates with a router (192.168.1.1).
	- Attacker sends forged ARP replies, associating the router's IP with the attacker’s MAC address.
	- Attacker intercepts, modifies, or blocks the traffic.
- Impacts:
	- monitoring
	- Modification
	- Disruption
## On-path browser attack(man in the browser)
There is a malware/trojan that is configured as a proxy that is able to redirect traffic before and after it is send to the network 
**Key Details**:

- Runs as a proxy on the victim’s device.
- Can bypass encryption because it operates locally.
- Victim sees no indication of the attack.

- **Process**:
    1. Malware waits for the user to log into sensitive accounts (e.g., banking).
    2. Captures credentials like usernames and passwords.
    3. Uses stolen credentials to initiate unauthorized sessions (e.g., transferring money, making purchases).

**Impact**:
- Compromises account security even with encrypted traffic.
- Enables attackers to perform actions undetected by the victim

#### **Mitigations for ARP Poisoning and On-Path Attacks**

1. **Encryption**:
    - Use secure protocols like HTTPS, TLS, or VPNs to encrypt sensitive traffic.
    - Prevent attackers from reading intercepted data.
2. **Static ARP Entries**:
    - Manually set ARP entries for critical devices (e.g., gateways, servers).
3. **Network Segmentation**:
    - Limit the number of devices on a subnet to reduce attack surface.
4. **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**:
    - Use IDS tools to detect suspicious ARP traffic.
5. **Secure Browsing**:
    - Install antivirus software to detect malware/Trojans.
    - Regularly update operating systems and browsers.
6. **Authentication**:
    - Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for sensitive accounts to mitigate credential theft.
