**Logic bomb** -A **logic bomb** is a type of malicious code intentionally inserted into a software system by an attacker. Unlike other forms of malware that activate immediately, a logic bomb remains dormant until specific conditions are met. These conditions, or "triggers," can include actions such as a particular date and time, the deletion of a file, the launch of a certain application, or the occurrence of a specific system event. Once triggered, a logic bomb executes its payload, which can perform harmful actions like deleting or corrupting data, disrupting system operations, or launching further attacks.
