## ## Injection Attacks

- **Definition**: Exploit vulnerabilities by injecting malicious code into inputs sent to servers or client devices.
- **Key Types**:
    1. **SQL Injection**:
        - Injects malicious SQL commands to manipulate databases.
    2. **HTML/XML/LDAP Injection**:
        - Injects code into HTML, XML, or LDAP to exploit the application.
- **Cause**: Lack of proper input validation by the application.
- **Mitigation**:
    - Validate and sanitize all user inputs.
    - Use parameterized queries for database access.
    - Regularly patch and update software.
## Buffer overflows
- **Definition**: Occurs when more data is written to a memory buffer than it can hold, overflowing into adjacent memory.
- **Key Details**:
    - Exploits poorly designed applications that do not validate input sizes.
    - Can cause crashes or allow attackers to execute arbitrary code.
- **Challenges for Attackers**:
    - Difficult to exploit reliably due to varying memory configurations.
- **Mitigation**:
    - Enable **Data Execution Prevention (DEP)**: Restricts memory areas where code can execute.
    - Implement **Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)**: Randomizes memory locations to make exploitation harder.
## Replay Attack
- **Definition**: Reuses intercepted information (e.g., session IDs, username/password hashes) to impersonate a user.
- **Attack Process**:
    1. Attacker intercepts data using techniques like ARP poisoning or network taps.(wireshark)
    2. Replays the intercepted credentials to gain unauthorized access.
- **Mitigation**:
    - Use encryption (e.g., HTTPS) to prevent data interception.
    - Implement unique, time-bound tokens for each session.
    - Prevent reuse of authentication tokens or hashes.
- There are 2 different attacks that are occurring together, a on path attack and then replay attack to send the information to the server 

## Privilege  Escalation
- **Definition**: Exploits vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized elevated privileges.
- **Types**:
    1. **Vertical Privilege Escalation**:
        - Gains administrator or system-level privileges.
    2. **Horizontal Privilege Escalation**:
        - Gains access to another user's permissions without administrative rights.
- **Example**: **CVE-2023-29336** allowed attackers to gain system privileges in Windows operating systems.
	- Win32k kernal driver for certain servers and windows 10
	- attackers could get system privileges in windows OS 
- **Mitigation**:
    - Patch vulnerabilities promptly.
    - Use updated antivirus/anti-malware with signature databases.
    - Implement access controls and restrict privileged accounts.
    - Data execution prevention - this functions to limit what areas of memory a executable can run in. this can prevent exploits as it prevents running in certain areas of memory 
## Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- **Definition**: Exploits a trusted browser to perform unauthorized actions on a web application.
- when you login and connect to a website, your browser is trusted from the perspective of the server 
- **Key Details**:
    - Occurs when a victim is authenticated with a website.
    - Attacker tricks the victim into executing malicious requests (e.g., transferring funds).
- **Mitigation**:
    - Use **cryptographic anti-forgery tokens** for each transaction.
    - Implement checks to validate request origins.
    - Require re-authentication for sensitive actions.
## Directory Traversal

- **Definition**: Exploits misconfigurations to access files outside the web server's root directory.
- **Example**:
    - URL: `../../windows/system.ini` indicates an attempt to move up directories and access restricted files.
- **Causes**:
    - Misconfigured web servers or software vulnerabilities.
- **Mitigation**:
    - Restrict access to sensitive directories through proper server configurations.
    - Use application-level filters to block directory traversal patterns (e.g., `../`).
    - Regularly audit web server configurations.
