## What is malicious code ?
Malicious software or scripts used to exploit vulnerabilities and gain unauthorized access

Types of malicious code:
- **Executables**: Programs that infect a system when run.
- **Scripts**: Automated commands that perform harmful tasks.
- **Macro Viruses**: Embedded in documents and activated when the document is opened.
- **Trojan Horses**: Malicious software disguised as legitimate.
- **SQL Injection**: Exploits vulnerabilities in database query handling.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Injects malicious scripts into trusted websites.
## Examples of Malicious code
- **WannaCry Ransomware**:
    - Exploited a vulnerability in SMBv1 on Windows systems.
    - Allowed arbitrary code execution, enabling attackers to install ransomware.
    - Result: Systems were encrypted, and users were extorted for decryption keys.
- **British Airways XSS Attack**:
    - Injected 22 lines of malicious JavaScript into checkout pages.
    - Collected credit card information from approximately 380,000 victims.
- **Estonian Central Health Database SQL Injection**:
    - Attacked the country's central health database.
    - Breached health records for all citizens by exploiting SQL vulnerabilities.
## Defensive Measures Against Malicious Code

1. **Anti-Malware Tools**:
    - Block executables, scripts, and macro viruses before they can execute.
2. **Firewalls**:
    - Prevent malicious traffic from entering or leaving the network.
3. **Regular Updates and Patching**:
    - Address security vulnerabilities in software and operating systems.
4. **User Training**:
    - Educate users to:
        - Avoid clicking unknown links in emails.
        - Refrain from sharing sensitive information over the phone or online.
5. **Input Validation**:
    - Sanitize user inputs on websites to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.
6. **Secure Configurations**:
    - Change default credentials and secure configurations for new devices.
