## What is a watering hole attack
A **watering hole attack** is a targeted cyberattack strategy where the attacker **compromises websites** (or services) that a particular group or organization is known to frequent. The goal is to “poison” these popular or trusted sites so that, when the target group’s members visit, **malware** (or other malicious content) can be silently delivered to their systems.

"The attacker poisons the watering hole and then waits for you to visit"
## Executing the watering hole attack
- Attacker will firstly need to determine what websites the victim group uses 
- Educated guess or waits at the local coffee shop or sandwich shop to check out what you are doing 
- Industry related sites 
- The attacker will then infect one of these third-party sites through a vulnerability in the site or email attachment 
- by infecting the waterhole the attacker is affecting everyone that is using the site but eventually they are looking to get their target(specific victim)
## Watching the watering hole
There isn't one thing that can prevent a watering hole attack. 
- You need to have a layered defense meaning there is defense in depth that contains a AV, a IDP and a  firewall 
- multiple layers of security are required.
- Firewalls are Intrusion prevention systems are normally bundled together because of it might get through the firewall but the Intrusion prevention system is able to detect that it is malicious network traffic 
- Anti virus and anti malware systems are also required as they add another layer of security 
- if it gets through the other systems you increase your chances of detection by adding more layers.
