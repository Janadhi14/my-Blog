## Misinformation/disinformation
One very good social engineering technique is to disseminate factually incorrect information, this creates confusion and division which makes it easier for attackers to make money
- Misinformation or disinformation can be used to influence **campaigns** to **sway** the **public opinion** on **political** and **social issues** 
- **Nation-state actors** can carry this spread of disinformation in order to divide other nations or to distract them, leading to a beneficial outcome for them. 
- **Advertising** is an option that the attackers can use as they are able to use this to manipulate people  
- **Social media** is one of the main ways that these attackers create, share, like and amplify their content.(feeding frenzey)

## Misinformation process
This is how the 
- First the attackers will **Create fake users** 
- **Create** content 
- **Post** on social media
- **Amplify message** by getting the fake users to follow and like (partly backed by social media algorithms)
- **Real users** share the message
- **Mass media** picks up the story once it gets to a certain level of popular
## Brand impersonation
Another social engineering technique that is used is pretending to be a well-known brand such as cocacola, Mcdonalds or apple 
- these brand names are soo common that the attackers will create sites using these brand names and google will index these sites with the main brand and then they can redirect the user to  this fake site 
- Visitor are presented with a pop-up which is probably going to give your computer malware
