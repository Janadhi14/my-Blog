## What is the Triple A framework
The Triple A framework revolves around:
**Authentication** - Proves you are who you say you are. 
- password and other authentication factors such as MFA (Check between your username, password and other authentication factors like passkey or MFA)
**Authorization** - Based on your identity and authentication what accesses to certain resources and processes do you have 
**Accounting** - refers to the resources used such as login time, data sent and received logout time 
## Authenticating people
Example:
Suppose there is a client that needs to access an internal file server:
- firstly the client will go through the internet and attempt to gain access to an internet server, 
- First they well reach the VPN concentrator/Firewall that will prompt them for their credentials(username and password)
- The concentrator sends this information to the Triple A server that will check the credentials and returns result (approved or unapproved ) 
- The client can now establish a connection to the internal file server

You have to manage many devices and often devices that you have never physically seen or will see this creates an issue and in additon to that there may be systems that don't have physical people that are using them

## Authenticating Systems
A System can't type a password and you may not want to store one so how can we authenticate a device?

How can we make sure that the system is really allowed to be on our network?
- We are able to put a **digitally signed certificate** on the device. 
- This functions as an authentication method and can be applied on a **VPN concentrator** that will check that the device is allowed to connect to the network.

## Certificate Authentication 
In order to authenticate devices onto a network in an organization you require a CA(certificate authority)
### Certificate Authority
A certificate authority is a trusted entity that issues secure sockets layer certificates. A CA is essentially a device or software that is responsible for managing all of the certificates in our environment.
- Most Organizations maintain their own CA 
- The organization creates a certificate for a device and digitally signs the certificate with the organization's CA 
- Then you put the certificate on the device

## Certificate-based authentication
- A CA also has a certificate that is singed by the root CA.
- The device certificate is signed by the Certificate authority certificate. 
## Authorization models
Once the device has the ability to authenticate we need an authorization model. 

- Certain users should be granted access to certain resources such as data and applications. 
- We can associate individual users to access rights doesn't scale well as you will have to apply for each user permissions
- We can put an authorization model in the model by defining roles within the organization and then putting certain users within these roles, we apply a group policy to the roles which will grant every user within the group access to the resources.

In order to scale you will need an authorization model 
- we add a layer of abstraction on top of the users 
- we create a new group for the users 
- add the users to the group
