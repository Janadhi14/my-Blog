## What is Non-repudiation?
Non-repudiation is the security concept where a party involved in a digital transaction or communication cannot later deny that they sent or received a message

We can achieve non repudiation through:
- proof of integrity 
- proof of origin with high assurance of authenticity 


## Proof of integrity 
- This means that nothing in the data has been changed (the data that was sent is the same as the data that was received )
- We can use a Hash of the plain text can be used to achieve proof of integrity.
	- A hash is a short string of text that can be created based on the data contains in the plain text using an algorithm.
	- This hash is often called a message digest or a fingerprint 
	- If anything changes with the data the hash will also be a different hash 
	- Hashes don't associate individuals with data, it only associated the sent with the received data 
Eg:
if you go to:
 [[https://www.md5hashgenerator.com/|md5 hash generator]]

If you put "You will pass your comptia Security+ exam" into te converter 
You will generate a hash
MD5 hash: 24b9e7f926251e524f68857ada5d5d4c

Notice that now if you change the input to "You will pass your comptia Security+" you will get a completely different hash
MD5 hash: d365e4ab02b0f13a1d87193ccf9c9e07

If the data is different between the 2 we can say that the data integrity may have been compromised.

## Proof of origin
proof of origin refers to the fact that nothing was changed 
- Use a private key to sign the document that only the person who owns the public/private key pair can have 
- we verify using a public key to check that the encrypted hash of the plain text message is valid.
- Digital signature = hash of plaintext + individuals private key

## Example
Digital signature creation:
- Generate a hash of the plain text
- encrypt the hash with the private key to generate the digital signature
- attach the digital signature to the message(plaintext)
Digital signature verification:
