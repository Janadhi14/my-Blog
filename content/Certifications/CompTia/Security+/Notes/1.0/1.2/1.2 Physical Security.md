## Barricades/bollards
- prevents access to certain areas
- This can allow for only people to pass through and not any cars trucks or other vehicles to pass through
- Bollards can also be brightly colored and thus can indicate to people that this is a secure area. 
- You can also create barricades in other ways 
	- concrete barriers
	- Moats- water surrounding a structure 
## Access control vestibules
- This is a small, enclosed space at the entrance of a building that acts as a security checkpoint.
- 2 sets of interlocking doors 
- opening and closing of the doors are set up in a way that only one door is open at a time
- prevents tailgating and piggybacking 
- A mantrap doesn't have a window but a access control vestibule does 
- Example: Data center 

## Fencing 
This is another physical security control that functions to build a perimeter that is usually very obvious
- Fence can be transparent or opaque 
- The fence should be very robust 
- Higher fences with razor wires should be used for higher security areas. 

## Video surveillance
CCTV stands for closed circuit television that can replace physical guards 
- Camera features are important 
- Motion recognition can alarm and alert when something moves 
- Object detection can identify a license plate or persons face 
- Often many different cameras are networked together and the information is sent to a central location to be recorded and monitored.
## Guards and access badges
Security guards provide physical security at the reception areas of a facility 
- they function to validate identification of existing employees
- Theres normally 2 security guards as this minimized exposure to an attack as no single person should have access to a physical asset (2 person integrity/control )
- Access badges are normally used in organizations that contains picture, name and other details 
	- must be worn at all times
	- electronically logged (integrated with electronic scanning systems)
## Lighting
More light means more security as:
- attackers avoid the light 
- easier to see when lit 
- Non-Ir cameras can see better  
Finding the right lighting for the area can be important
- important for facial recognition
Avoid shadows and glare


## Sensors
Infrared based sensors
- detects infrared radiation in both light and dark 
- common in motion detectors
- best for smaller spaces 
- 
Pressure sensors
- Detects a change in force 
- floor and window sensors 

Microwaves
- detects movements across large areas 

Ultrasonic
-  Sends ultrasonic signals
-  the reflected sound wave is recieved 
- Functions to detect motion and collisions in large areas
