## What is Gap Analysis
Study of **where we are** compared to **where we want to be** and this might require extensive research which can take a long time to gather the information. 

Before the Gap analysis we need to get a baseline of where we are currently in terms of our security posture and a baseline that we want to work towards
## Choosing the framework
There are certain baselines that already exist:
- NIST special publication 800-171 revision2 
- ISO/IEC 27001

You can also have your own baseline that meets the requirements of your organization
## Evaluate people and processes
When starting the gap analysis process we should get a baseline of the employees:
- Formal experience 
- current training
- Knowledge of security policies and procedures 
After gathering information about the people within the organization we will need to gather information about the current processes within the organization:
- check the current IT systems 
- Evaluate existing security policies 

## Compare and contrast
The analysis portion of the gap analysis will consist of comparing the existing system that you have running in the current. environment to identify any weaknesses that the systems might have
- we can also compare these weaknesses in the current system

We create a detailed analysis:
- examine broad security categories 
- break those into smaller categories

## The analysis and report 
The gap analysis report contains:
- Where we are today(formal description of the current situation)
- Recommendations for meeting the baseline
- How we are going to achieve the new goals
