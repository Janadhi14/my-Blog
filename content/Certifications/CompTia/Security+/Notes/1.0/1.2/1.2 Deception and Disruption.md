## Honeypots
What is a honey pot?
- A honey pot is a decoy system or network resource deliberately set up to attract and trap cyber attackers, while closely monitoring their activities.
- you want to see what type of automation the attacker is using and we want to monitor what they are trying to do to improve our real systems
-  There is a race between real from fake 
## Honeynet
A honeynet is a network of honeypots consisting of multiple machines, servers, switches routers firewalls that mimic a real network to make the fake infrastructure look real to attackers

## Honeyfiles
Honey files are fake files that attract attackers as they contain fake information that seems real to attackers. 

Honey files named like passwords.txt or usernames.txt will stand out to attackers and this will keep them busy.

In the normal production environment no one should be accessing these honey files so if someone does;
- have alerts set up to see that someone is poking around in the honey files.
## Honeytokens
Honey tokens are bits of tracable information that functions to track malicious actors as we can see who posted the stolen data even though it is fake.

eg: putting API credentials on a public site

Honeytokens can be any type of data:
browser cookies, API credentials, pixels on a picture
