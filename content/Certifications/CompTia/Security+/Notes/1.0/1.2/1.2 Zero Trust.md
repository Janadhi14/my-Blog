## What is Zero Trust?
- Most networks are open on the inside, once you are inside a network you there are less security controls and you can access different services and resources as you please. 
- Zeros trust is a holistic approach to network security where by every device, process and person have to authenticate prior to accessing anything on a network.
- Everything must be verified and nothing is inherently trusted 
## Planes of operation
- One of the ways you can implement zero trust is through breaking the the network into function planes 
- This applies to physical, virtual and cloud components in a network
#### Data Plane
The data plane refers the part of the device that is preforming the actual processing of the data 

  
#### Control Plane
Manages the actions of the data plane
- Defines policies and rules
- Determines how packets should be forwarded
- Routing tables session tables nad NAT tables

## Controlling Trust
**Adaptive identity** refers to an identity management approach that automatically adjusts how it recognizes and authenticates a user based on context, behaviors, and changing risk factors

Context-Aware:
- The system notices things like your usual login locations, the device you normally use, and your typical behavior. If you follow your normal patterns, it might only ask for a simple password or just recognize you automatically.
Risk-Based:
- If something unusual happens—like you trying to sign in from a new country or on a device it’s never seen before—the system “adapts” by asking for additional proof (like a text message code or a biometric scan).
Continuous Adjustment:
- Over time, the system keeps learning. It updates security requirements based on your current situation. If you consistently log in from a new place, it eventually treats that as normal

Example: 
When you are logging into google you may be required to do a MFA if you are logging in from a different location. but if you do this repeatedly from a different location it won't require you to do that.

**Threat scope** reduction simply means **shrinking the ways an attacker can cause harm** in your system or environment.
- limiting the attack surface 


Once we have all this information inplace we can start making a Policy driven access control that examines all of the individual datapoints and puts them all together to decide what type of authentication process should be used:
- Combine the adaptive identity with a predefined set of rules 
 

## Security Zones
**Security zones** let you classify different parts of your network by their level of trust, helping you easily apply rules that **allow or deny** traffic between those zones
- Security Zones can be implemented by chekcing where youa recoming from and wehre you are going. 
- Trusted to untrusted or viceversa 
- Internal or external
- VPN1 -> VPN5 -> VPN 11
- Marketing to IT to Accounting to HR 

Eg you might want to deny access to anyone coming from an untrusted to a trusted zone traffic
- we can use these zones to create implicit trust.


## Policy enforcement point 
The policy enforcement point- When someone (or something) tries to access a resource, the **Policy Enforcement Point** (gatekeeper) intercepts the request and asks the **Policy Decision Point** (judge) for an answer.

Subjects are ususally:
- users 
- processes running on a system
- Applications in use

All traffic must pass through the **policy enforcement point**.

The **policy Enforcement point** gathers the information and provides it to the **policy decision point**, specifically the **policy administrator** in the PDP.

The **policy decision point** is responsible for examine the authentication and making a decision on whether the subject should be allowed on the network. 
![[PolicyDecisionPoint.png|200]]
The **policy decision point** consists of:
- **Policy Engine** 
- **Policy Administrator**

**Policy Engine** - Examines the request and compares the traffic to a set of pre-defined policies and then makes a decision on whether that is granted, denied or revoked 

**Policy Administrator** - Takes the outcome of the **policy engine**(granted, denied or revoked) and communicates with the **policy enforcement point** to allow or disallow access.
- generates access tokens or credentials 


## Zero Trust across planes
![[Zerotrustimplementation.png]]

- Initially there will be a request for access to a resource/data from a system coming in from an untrusted network.
- First, the **Policy Enforcement Point (PEP)** receives this request and forwards it to the **Policy Administrator (PA)**, which then passes it to the **Policy Engine (PE)**.
- The **Policy Engine** (often working in the **Policy Decision Point (PDP)**) evaluates the request against the organization’s defined policies (the “rules”).
- Based on these rules, the Policy Engine decides whether to allow or deny access.
- This decision is then sent back through the **Policy Administrator** to the **policy enforcement point**, which ultimately allows or denies the request to the resource."
