## What is Zero Trust?
- Most networks are open on the inside, once you are inside a network you there are less security controls and you can access different services and resources as you please. 
- Zeros trust is a holistic approach to network security where by every device, process and person have to authenticate prior to accessing anything on a network.
- Everything must be verified and nothing is inherently trusted 
## Planes of operation
- One of the ways you can implement zero trust is through breaking the the network into function planes 
- This applies to physical, virtual and cloud components in a network
#### Data Plane
The data plane refers the part of the device that is preforming the actual processing of the data 

  
#### Control Plane
Manages the actions of the data plane
- Defines policies and rules
- Determines how packets should be forwarded
- Routing tables session tables nad NAT tables

## Controlling Trust
**Adaptive identity** refers to an identity management approach that automatically adjusts how it recognizes and authenticates a user based on context, behaviors, and changing risk factors

Context-Aware:
- The system notices things like your usual login locations, the device you normally use, and your typical behavior. If you follow your normal patterns, it might only ask for a simple password or just recognize you automatically.
Risk-Based:
- If something unusual happens—like you trying to sign in from a new country or on a device it’s never seen before—the system “adapts” by asking for additional proof (like a text message code or a biometric scan).
Continuous Adjustment:
- Over time, the system keeps learning. It updates security requirements based on your current situation. If you consistently log in from a new place, it eventually treats that as normal

Example: 
When you are logging into google you may be required to do a MFA if you are logging in from a different location. but if you do this repeatedly from a different location it won't require you to do that.

**Threat scope** reduction simply means **shrinking the ways an attacker can cause harm** in your system or environment.
- limiting the attack surface 

Policy driven access control:
- Combine the adaptive identity with a predefined set of rules 
 

## Security Zones
**Security zones** let you classify different parts of your network by their level of trust, helping you easily apply rules that **allow or deny** traffic between those zones
- examines
