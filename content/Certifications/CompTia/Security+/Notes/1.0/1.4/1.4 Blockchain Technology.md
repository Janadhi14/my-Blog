## What is blockchain?
- A blockchain is a type of distributed ledger technology where transactions or data are recorded in "blocks," which are then linked or "chained" together using cryptographic techniques.
- A ledger is a record-keeping system that documents and maintains a list of transactions or events over time 
- everyone on the blockchain network maintains the ledger 
- Can be used for vaious things such as :
	- payment processing
	- digital identification
	- supply chain monitoring
	- Digital voting

## The blockchain process
- **Transaction Initiation**: A user creates a transaction, such as sending cryptocurrency to another user.
- **Broadcasting**: This transaction is broadcast to a network of computers(every computer in the network), referred to as nodes.
- **Validation**: The nodes verify the transaction’s authenticity and check if the sender has enough balance or if the data is valid.
- **Block Creation**: Once enough valid transactions accumulate, they are grouped into a new “block.”
- **Consensus Algorithm**: The nodes follow a consensus mechanism (e.g., Proof of Work or Proof of Stake) to determine which block to add to the blockchain next.
- **Appending to the Chain**: The validated block is added to the chain, referencing the previous block via a cryptographic hash. This creates a chronological, unchangeable chain of blocks.
- **New Block Broadcast**: The updated blockchain is distributed to all nodes so that the entire network stays in sync.
