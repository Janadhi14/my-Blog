## Sharing keys
After generating keys there can be a problem that arises when we go to share keys as it may occur through an insecure medium. There are multiple ways we can resolve this:
- **Out-of-band key exchange** - this is the process of sending the symmetric key through a different medium such as telephone, courier
	- This can be logistically not possible and may also be insecure 
- **In-band key exchange** - This is an exchange that is completed on the network and is protected by a key with additional encryption 
	- uses asymmetric encryption to deliver a **symmetric key** 
## Real-time encryption and decryption
There is a requirement for fast security eg we need to establish fast secure connections
-  We can share a symmetric session key using asymmetric encryption
	- Client wants to establish a secure connection to a sever
	- Client encrypts a random symmetric key with the servers public key and sends it to the server, 
	- Server uses its private key to decrypt the symmetric key(shared key) and uses it to encrypt data to communicate with the client 
	- This is the session key
## Symmetric key from asymmetric keys
Public key cryptography(Asymmetric) can be used to create a symmetric key between 2 devices without sending the symmetric key across the network

**Derivation of a shared symmetric key:**

Here’s what’s happening conceptually in Diffie-Hellman:

1. **Each participant generates a key pair:**
    
    - Each party (say Alice and Bob) creates a private key, which they keep secret.
    - Each party also derives a corresponding public key, which can safely be shared with anyone.
2. **Exchange of public keys:**
    
    - Alice sends her public key to Bob.
    - Bob sends his public key to Alice.
3. **Derivation of a shared symmetric key:**
    
    - Alice takes Bob’s public key and mathematically combines it with her private key to produce a shared secret key.
    - Bob takes Alice’s public key and mathematically combines it with his private key to produce the same shared secret key.
