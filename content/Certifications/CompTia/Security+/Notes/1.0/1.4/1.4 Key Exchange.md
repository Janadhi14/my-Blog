## Sharing keys
After generating keys there can be a problem that arises when we go to share keys as it may occur through an insecure medium. There are multiple ways we can resolve this:
- Out-of-band key exchange - this is the process of sending the symmetric key through a different medium such as telephone, courier
	- This can be logistically not possible and may also be insecure 
- In-band key exchange - This is an exchange that is completed on the network and is protected by a key with additional encryption that uses asymmetric encryption to deliver a symmetric key 
ephemeral keys
