## Trusted Platform Module(TPM)
A TPM is a standardized piece of hardware that contains:
- random number generator 
- key generator
- persistent memory so thus there are unique keys that are burned in during manufacturing.
- Versatile memory meaning that it functions to store keys that are generated.
- No way to use brute force to get into a TPM
- Generally for a single device 
## HSM 
- This is a hardware security module that is used in large environments
- Used to many devices 
- Securely stores thousands of cryptographic keys
- 


## Key management system

## Keeping data private 

## Secure enclave
A secure enclave (sometimes called a “trusted execution environment”) is a hardware-based isolation area within a **device’s processor** that is designed to protect sensitive data and operations.
- This is a security processor that is built into a computer system
- This is a hardware processor 
- isolated from the main processor 
- tamper-resistant
- Provides extensive security 
- typically handles cryptographic key generation
