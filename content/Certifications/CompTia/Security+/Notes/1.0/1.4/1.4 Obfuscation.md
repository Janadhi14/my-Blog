## What is obfuscation?
This is the idea of making something unclear.
- Making something that is obvious more difficult to understand for someone
- Revolves around the idea of hiding information in plain sight 
- For example you can hide information inside of an image which is called steganography
## Steganography 
Greek for "concealed writing" as there is security through obscurity. 
- The message is invisible but it is there and only visible to the trained eye
- The **covertext** is the document that contains the data you are hiding  
## Common steganography techniques 
- Network based steganography is common where you are sending messages in TCP packets.
	- If you know how the messages are being sent over the network then you can reconstruct the message.
