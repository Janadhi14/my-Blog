## Encrypting stored data
- If you need to encrypt data on an SSD, hard drive, usb, cloud storage etc, this is referred to as encrypting data at rest 
- For Full -disk and partition/volum encryption you can use 
	- Bitlocker -windows
	- FileVault-Mac
- For individual file encryption use:
	- EFS- encrypting file system - windows that is built into the NTFS file system
		-NTFS file system refers to New technology file system 
## Database encryption
- **Transparent** encryption - symmetric encryption to encrypt everything
- **Record- level** encryption - uses symmetric encryption to encrypt individual columns 
	- uses seperate symmetric keys for each column


## Transport encryption
Protect data traversing the network 
Encrypting in the applicaiton such as HTTPs
- VPN - Encrypts all data transmitted over the network regardless of the application 
	- Client-based VPN uses SSL/TLS
	- Site to Site VPN using IPSec

## Encryption algorithms
- Many different algorithms such as AES, RSA
- Both sides that wish to communicate must decide on an algorithm before encrypting the data 
	- The details are often hidden from the end user 
	-
