## Encrypting stored data
- If you need to encrypt data on an SSD, hard drive, usb, cloud storage etc, this is referred to as encrypting data at rest 
- For Full -disk and partition/volume encryption you can use 
	- Bitlocker -windows
	- FileVault-Mac
- For individual file encryption use:
	- EFS- encrypting file system - windows that is built into the NTFS file system
		-NTFS file system refers to New technology file system 
## Database encryption
- **Transparent** encryption - symmetric encryption to encrypt everything
- **Record- level** encryption - uses symmetric encryption to encrypt individual columns 
	- uses seperate symmetric keys for each column


## Transport encryption
Protect data traversing the network 
Encrypting in the application such as HTTPs
- VPN - Encrypts all data transmitted over the network regardless of the application 
	- Client-based VPN uses SSL/TLS
	- Site to Site VPN using IPSec

## Encryption algorithms
- Many different algorithms such as AES, RSA
- Both sides that wish to communicate must decide on an algorithm before encrypting the data 
	- The details are often hidden from the end user 
- There are advantages and disadvantages between different algorithms eg speed, complexity, overhead, security level
	- DES - Uses a 64 bit plain text to generate a 64bit cipher text 
	- AES - multiple output sizes 
## Cryptographic keys
We know exactly how the algorithms work 
- Only thing we don't know is the key
	- Similar to the idea of a door lock, you know how it works but you need the key to get in 
## Key Length
- Larger keys tend to be more secure because they prevent brute force attacks as they cannot try every possible combination
- Symmetric encryption generally uses 128 bit or larger keys and the numbers get larger and larger over time 
- Asymmetric encryption uses complex math but still susceptible to brute force attack 
	- common to see key lengths of 3072 bits or larger for Asymmetric encryption 
## Key stretching 
- This is the process of hashing the hash of the hash, 
- we use multiple processes to strengthen the key 
- This means that a malicious threat actor would need to spend more time reversing each of the hashes 
- can be called key stretching or key strengthening
