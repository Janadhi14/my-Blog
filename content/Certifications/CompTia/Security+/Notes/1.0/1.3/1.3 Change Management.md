## What is change management
When we need to make a change to a system, patch an applications or upgrade a software, configure a firewall or config / modify a switch port we are going to have to take the right precautions to ensure that things go smoothly and nothing is affected in an bad way.

## Change approval process
For large changes that affect multiple users we need a formal process for managingn the change in order to:
- avoiding downtime, 
- avoiding confusion 
- preventing mistakes
A typical approval process contains the following:
- Complete the request forms 
- Determine the purpose of the change 
- identify the scope of the change
- scheduling a date and time 
- determine the affected systems and the impact of the change
- Analyze the risk associated with the change
- Get the end users to try the system to ensure everything is wokring properly
