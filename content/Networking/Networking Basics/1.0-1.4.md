# 1.1 Network Types

## What is the internet?
The internet is not owned by any individual or group
- The internet is a worldwide collection of interconnected networks 
- Each of these networks cooperates with each other to exchange information using a common set of standards through:
	- Telephone wires
	- fibre-optic cables
	- wireless transmissions 
	- satellite links
## Local networks
What are **local networks**?
- A local network is a group of connected computers and devices within a limited geographic area—such as a home, office, or campus—that enables users to share resources (like files, printers, or internet access) and communicate quickly and efficiently
Types of Local networks:
#### Small home network
- Small. home networks connect a few computers to each other and to the internet 
#### Small Office and home Office network
- Often referred to as SOHO network
- Allows computers in a home office or a remote office to connect to a corporate network.
- Can allow for access to centralized resources. 
#### Medium to Large Networks
- Medium to large networks are often used by coporations and schools
- can have many locations with hundreds or thousands of interconnected hosts 
#### World Wide Networks
The internet is a network of networks that connects hundreds of millions of computers world-wide.


## Different types of connected devices 
#### RFID tags
- RFID stands for Radio frequency Identification
- These are small devices that can be placed in or on objects to track them or monitor sensors for many conditions

There are 2 types of tags:
- **Passive Tags**: Do not have their own power source. They rely on the electromagnetic field emitted by an RFID reader to power the microchip inside the tag.
- **Active Tags**: Contain their own power source (like a small battery), which allows them to transmit signals over a greater range.

- Each RFID tag contains a unique identifier and sometimes additional stored data

**RFID Reader (or Interrogator)**
- Emits a radio frequency signal.
- Detects and interprets the signals returned by RFID tags.
- Transfers the collected data to a computer system for further processing.

How does a RFID tag and a reader work together?
- When an RFID reader sends out a signal, it energizes passive tags within range.
- The tag’s microchip then modulates and reflects back a signal containing its stored data.
- **Active tags** **can initiate communication on their own due to their battery-powered design** and have a longer read range.

RFID technology streamlines processes by allowing for faster scanning and more accurate, real-time data collection than manual or barcode-based methods.
# 1.2 Data Transmission
## Types of personal data 
What exactly is data?
Data refers to **raw, unorganized facts or measurements that, on their own, lack context or meaning**. These can be numbers, text, images, audio, or any other form of recordable information. When data is analyzed or processed—such as being sorted, interpreted, or placed into a framework—it becomes information that can be understood and used for decision-making

Data can be categorized into to 
- **Volunteered** data 
	- Information that individuals intentionally and proactively share
	- The user is aware of and consents to providing this data.
- **Inferred** data:
	- Information that is derived or predicted using analytics and algorithms applied to volunteered and observed data
	- Inferred data is not directly provided or observed; it is _calculated_ through analysis of existing data
- **Observed** data:
	- Information collected without the user explicitly providing it. Instead, it is gathered by observing user actions or behaviors.
	- The user may not always realize this data is being collected, as it is often collected automatically.
## The bit
- Computers use binary code to represent and interpret letters, numbers and special characters 
- Networks only work in binary digits.
- All of our data is stored and transmitted as a series of bits
- A bit is stored and transmitted as one of two possible discrete states
### What exactly is a bit?
- This is the **smallest unit data in a computer**
- It can only have one of two possible values: **0** or **1**.
- At a **physical level**, these two states can be represented in various way. For example:
	- as high or low voltage in electronic circuits
	- as magnetized or demagnetized spots on a hard drive.

Letters, numbers and Characters can be represented as 1s or 0s
- **Capital letter:** A = 01000001
- **Number:** 9 = 00111001
- **Special character:** # = 00100011

## Data transmission methods
After the data is transformed into a series of bits, it must be converted into signals that can be sent across the network media to its destination

- Media refers to the physical medium on which the signals are transmitted. For example:
	- Copper wire
	- fibre optic cable
	- Electromagnetic waves through air
-  A signal consists of electrical or optical patterns that are transmitted from one connected device to another and The patterns represent the digital bits (i.e. the data) and travel across the media from source to destination as either a series of pulses of electricity, pulses of light, or radio waves. 
- Signals may be converted many times before ultimately reaching the destination, as corresponding media changes between source and destination.



There are three common methods of signal transmission used in networks:

- **Electrical signals -** Transmission is achieved by representing data as electrical pulses on copper wire.
- **Optical signals -** Transmission is achieved by converting the electrical signals into light pulses.
- **Wireless signals -** Transmission is achieved by using infrared, microwave, or radio waves through the air.

- Most homes and small businesses, network signals are transmitted across copper wires (cables) or Wi-Fi enabled wireless connections. 

- Larger networks employ fiber-optic cables in order to reliably carry signals for longer distances.
# 1.3 Bandwidth and throughput
What is bandwidth?
- Bandwidth is the _maximum_ capacity of a network link or communication channel to transfer data, usually measured in bits per second (bps), like Mbps (megabits per second) or Gbps (gigabits per second).
- Bandwidth is the capacity of a medium to carry data
What is **throughput**?
- **Throughput** is the _actual_ data transfer rate you experience at any given time in a real-world situation. Throughput can be lower than the maximum bandwidth due to network congestion, hardware limitations, signal quality, or protocol overhead.
- Throughput measurements **do not take into account the validity** or **usefulness** of the **bits being transmitted and received**

Due to a number of factors, **throughput** does not usually match the specified **bandwidth**. Many factors influence throughput including:

- The **amount of data being sent and received over the connection**
- The **types** of data being transmitted
- The **latency** created by the **number of network devices** encountered between source and destination

In an internetwork or network with multiple segments, throughput **cannot** be **faster than the slowest link of the path from sending device to the receiving device.**

**Latency** refers to the **amount of time**, including delays, for data to travel **from one given point to another**.

## Common bandwidth measurements

| Unit of Bandwidth   | Abbreviation | Equivalence                               |
| ------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Bits per second     | bps          | 1 bps = fundamental unit of bandwidth     |
| Kilobits per second | Kbps         | 1 Kbps = 1,000 bps = 10³ bps              |
| Megabits per second | Mbps         | 1 Mbps = 1,000,000 bps = 10⁶ bps          |
| Gigabits per second | Gbps         | 1 Gbps = 1,000,000,000 bps = 10⁹ bps      |
| Terabits per second | Tbps         | 1 Tbps = 1,000,000,000,000 bps = 10¹² bps |
