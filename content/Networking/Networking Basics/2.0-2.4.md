# 2.1 Client and Server Roles


All computers connected to a network that participate directly in network communication are classified as hosts.


Servers are hosts that have software installed that enable them to provide information, like email or web pages, to other hosts on the network.


A peer-to-peer network consists of two directly connected computers where both computers are able to exchange data and services with each other, acting as either a client or a server as necessary.
